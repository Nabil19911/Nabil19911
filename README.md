# **Hey ðŸ‘‹, nice to have you around. :)**

 **LITTLE ABOUT ME.**
I am a self-taught developer. Yeah! I enjoy problem-solving. Isn't it amazing? Everything began as a hobby, and now I am enjoying my life by doing what I enjoy and getting good at each and everyday.

**TECH STACK ðŸ‘€**
 1. JavaScript (Loving it but still puzzled sometimes).
 2. TypeScript (Cool way of writing JavaScript, yes getting used to it's awesomeness).
 3. Python (My first friend, yeah! it made me fall in love with the prgramming).
 4. C# (All the languages above it help me understand and work with this bad boy smoothly, still needs to go long way but Game dev I am preparing lol!).
 5. HTML/CSS (All ways there, no matter what I do, without talking in their languages nothing complete).
 6. Reactjs (Yes, I am one in many).
 7. Nextjs (Almost there, batman version of reactjs).
 8. Vuejs (Not sure! But keeping it in the stack).
 9. MUI/Tailwindcss (Yeah! Helping me visually).
 10. Redux (Treasury box, I get eveything from there to make things work smoothly).
 11. Axios (It fetches things for me).
 12. Node (This is the world I live around, day starts and ends with in).
 13. Expressjs (Yeah! easy way of doing things behind your back, making little progress everyday to know it better).
 14. Nestjs (Another back stabber!).
